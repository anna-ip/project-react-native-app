# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

My first React Native App, trying out React native and Styled components, so I've made a Stopwatch with ios stopwatch as a model.

With a limited of time I dicided to follow a tutorial, and then use Styled component to style my app, as a second step I've been working on to Refactor my app to React Hooks.
If there would have been more time, I would have tried to finish the refactoring.
